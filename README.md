# PQNN Rare-State Selection Simulation

This repository contains a dynamic simulation that visualizes **Post-Quantum Neural Network (PQNN)** rare-state selection.  
The model demonstrates how PQNN reshapes the amplitude landscape so that rare quantum states become **energetically favorable**, **topologically accessible**, and **feedback-reinforced** ‚Äî rather than relying on probabilistic emergence alone.

The included HTML file is an interactive Plotly animation showing amplitude packets evolving across a reshuffling manifold, guided by curvature-sensitive attractors.

## üìú Background

In standard quantum mechanics, the **Born rule** governs the probability distribution of measurement outcomes.  
PQNN introduces a post-Born mechanism that actively **engineers the geometry and dynamics** of the state space to amplify rare states.

Key concepts illustrated in this simulation:
- **Reshuffling manifold**: Alters amplitude flow pathways
- **Curvature bias**: Guides trajectories toward attractor basins
- **Feedback loops**: Reinforce low-probability configurations
- **Temporal dynamics**: Shows how rare states emerge over time
